# Neighborhood Map project - Udacity

This project uses the Google Maps API and Knockout JS to create a website
for a service which lets users find nearby transit stops and plan a
public transit journey using the Danish Rejseplanen API.
(This service only works for locations in Denmark)

## Getting Started

Allow CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) for the website to load external
services when opened in your browser.
[This] is a Chrome plugin which will allow CORS requests.

## Launch the site

Open the index.html file in your favourite browser

## Examples
